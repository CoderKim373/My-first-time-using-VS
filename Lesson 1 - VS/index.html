    <h1>Human First</h1>
    <h2>Slogan: “To us… You go first.”</h2>
    <h3>Who Are We?</h3>
    <p>We are more than a herbal medicine brand. We are a wellness community built on one simple truth: You come first.
In everything we do — from the herbs we carefully select to the way we answer your calls — you are our first and only priority. With us, you truly go first.
</p>
    <h3>Our Mission:</h3>
    <p>At Human First, we believe that nature holds powerful answers for well-being, answers that often bypass the need for harsh chemical medicines.
Our goal is simple: to bring herbal medicine back to the people — clean, honest, sustainable, and crafted with love.
But we don’t stop at selling products. We offer something the modern world has forgotten: real conversations. Real care. Real solutions.
